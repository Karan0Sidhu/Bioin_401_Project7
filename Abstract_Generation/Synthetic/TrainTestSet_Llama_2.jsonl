Fox grapes (Vitis vinifera) have been found to contain a variety of bioactive compounds, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and stilbenes. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize the bioactive compounds present in Fox grapes and evaluate their potential therapeutic applications.\n\nMethods: We extracted and purified three compounds, 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate, sphinganine (C20), and tetradecanoyl-CoA, from Fox grapes using a combination of solvent extraction and chromatography techniques. We then evaluated the bioactivities of these compounds using in vitro assays, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), cell-based assays, and biochemical assays.\n\nResults: Our results showed that 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity, inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages. Sphinganine (C20) was found to have anticancer activity, inducing apoptosis in human breast cancer cells. Tetradecanoyl-CoA was found to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer activities, inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inducing apoptosis in cancer cells.\n\nDiscussion: Our findings suggest that Fox grapes are a rich source of bioactive compounds with potential therapeutic applications.

One of the key steps in this process is the incorporation of cytidine triphosphate (CTP) into the growing lipid chain. Our study investigated the role of CTP in cardiolipin biosynthesis, focusing on the specific isomeric forms of CTP involved in this process. We found that CTP(i-12:0/i-17:0/i-21:0/i-15:0) is a critical cofactor for cardiolipin synthesis, as its absence resulted in significantly reduced lipid chain elongation.
