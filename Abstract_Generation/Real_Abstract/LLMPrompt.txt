<abstract>
Extract semantic triples from the scientific abstract above. Strictly obey the following rules when extracting triples:
1. Output each semantic triple in the format [subject, predicate, object].
2. Only extract triples for which the subject is a biomarker.
3. Only extract triples where there is a chemical or biological relationship between the subject and object.
4. Ensure that each predicate is only 1-2 words long.
5. Do not create any fictitious data that is not present in the abstract.
6. Extract semantic triples from the scientific abstract above using the following steps:
7. Find triples that include the location of a biomarker, use the predicate "biolocation is".
8. Find triples that include how one is exposed to a biomarker, use the predicate "exposed through".
9. Find triples that include foods a biomarker is found in, use the predicate "sourced through".
10. Find triples that include the effects a biomarker causes, use the predicate "causes".
11. Find triples that include the processes a biomarker is involved in, use the predicate "involved in".
12. Find triples that include the role that a biomarker has, use the predicate "has role of" for this triple.
13. Do not include any triples that have not been found using the previous steps. If no triples are found, it is ok.
14. Do not generate any fictitious data or include any information that is not present in the abstract.
15. Output each triple in the format [subject, predicate, object].
